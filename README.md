# Spine
A viewer for the game's Spine models, made from the [edited spine-libgdx runtimes](https://github.com/DALFC/spine-runtimes).
Note: All 4 Zadkiel models had to be edited to remove the black matte, because blend modes don't work great with transparent background. You can still find the original sprite in their folders
Sorry for the bad UI and UX :<. Probably doesn't work on mobile
